## What is mobject?

Pronounced mob-ject.

A sprinkling of OOP is usually enough to simplify and unclutter procedural code. However, the more you apply OOP, the more you find the need to expand it's scope to accommodate functionality which is missing from the language. Hence, mobject was conceived. It's a framework, library and mindset of how problems such as this can be resolved using both pre-written code and examples.

mobject's goal is to be a lightweight solution to typical oop problems.

## Where to find it?

The main website for mobject can be found [here](http://mobject.org)

## Important notes regarding this project

Please be aware that this project is in its alpha phase and we strongly advise against using any part of it in production environments. Any decision to implement libraries that are in beta or release stages should be made cautiously and at your own risk.

Please feel free to contribute, copy and use code.

Mobject has been created for TwinCAT. Mobject may use reflection, TwinCAT Pragmas and libraries so porting to other controllers may not be possible.
