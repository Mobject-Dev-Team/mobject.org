## What is mobject?

Pronounced mob-ject.

A sprinkling of OOP is usually enough to simplify and unclutter procedural code. However, the more you apply OOP, the more you find the need to expand it's scope to accommodate functionality which is missing from the language. Hence, mobject was conceived. It's a framework, library and mindset of how problems such as this can be resolved using both pre-written code and examples.

mobject's goal is to be a lightweight solution to typical oop problems.

## Why use Mobject?

1. Enhanced Productivity: Mobject libraries, like mobject-collections, provide developers with efficient and flexible data structures and tools, reducing the time and effort required to implement complex solutions. As a result, developers can focus on the core functionality of their applications.

2. Improved Code Organization: Mobject encourages modular design, making it easier to structure and maintain code. This leads to cleaner, more readable code, which can be easily understood by other developers and updated as needed.

3. Extensibility: The Mobject framework is designed to be highly extensible, allowing developers to build upon existing libraries and create new ones tailored to their specific needs. This ensures that Mobject remains relevant and adaptable to a wide range of applications.

4. Community Support: By adopting Mobject, developers can leverage a growing community of users and contributors, fostering the exchange of ideas, solutions, and support. This collaborative environment helps to drive innovation and improvements within the Mobject ecosystem.

5. Cross-Domain Applicability: Mobject's generic approach makes it suitable for a variety of domains, from industrial control systems to web development and beyond. This broad applicability ensures that developers can use Mobject to tackle diverse challenges with a unified approach.

In summary, Mobject offers a comprehensive and versatile solution to common OOP problems, empowering developers to create efficient, organized, and maintainable code across a wide range of applications. By harnessing the power of Mobject and its growing ecosystem, developers can elevate their programming skills and build better software.

## Important notes regarding this project

We are currently in the early stages of developing this software. In the spirit of transparency and community collaboration, we have made this a public repository to allow visibility into our ongoing work. Please be aware that this project is in its alpha phase and we strongly advise against using any part of it in production environments. Any decision to implement libraries that are in beta or release stages should be made cautiously and at your own risk.

Please feel free to contribute, copy and use code.

Mobject has been created for TwinCAT. Mobject may use reflection, TwinCAT Pragmas and libraries so porting to other controllers may not be possible.

## Coding style and convention

Mobject follows the styling convention found [here](https://mobject-dev-team.github.io/mobject-coding-convention/#/)
